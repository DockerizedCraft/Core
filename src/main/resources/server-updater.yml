# Environment variables of the containers
# Type: Section
environment-variables:
  # The events listener will only add server with the defined environment variable
  # ie. docker run -e TYPE=minecraft_spigot my_server
  # Type: String
  identifier: TYPE

  # Be default the first exposed port is taken if the container exposes multiple ports you can
  # set it by setting the PORT environment variable in the container
  # If you exposed multiple ports its highly recommended to set the environment variable
  # Type: String
  port: SERVER_PORT

  # Setting the motd in the Bungeecord setting
  # i.e. docker run -e SERVER_FORCED_HOST="Another Minecraft Server" playerworld:latest
  # Type: String

  # Each server name needs to be unique
  # If you are not able to control if it is unique (autoscaling or whatever) you should not set it in your container
  # If you do not set the environment variable the container name itself will be used
  # Two server with the same name will overwrite each other
  # Type: String
